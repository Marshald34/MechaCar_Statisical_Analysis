**##Linear Regression to Predict**

  Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  
  
  Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or Why not?
  
  Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or Why not?
  
  
  **## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition**
  
  
  Most important rating for vehicles is safety followed by fuel efficiency. 
  
  What metric or metrics are you going to test?
    - Vehicle safety and fuel efficiency: hypothesis cars with better fuel efficiency are safer. 
         
  What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
    -A car with better fuel efficiency is not safer. 
    
  What statisical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And Why?
    -could use multiple linear regression. One to plot vehicle safety and one to plot fuel efficiency and compare the output
    
  What data is needed to run the statistical test? 
    -Dataframe of vehicles with safety rating and fuel efficiency.
